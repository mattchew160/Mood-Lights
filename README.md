# Mood-Lights
My Mood Lights project

I'm am using this git repo to store what I'm working on and will update this repo as I make progress.
I am using a Ardunio nano, and the IDE that Ardunio uses to program this.

One thing that I decided to limit myself on is only using nanos. This is because Nanos do not have any PWM ports and this projects does not relay on PWM ports to function.
I did this simply because I have 5 extra nanos at home that are begging for prupose. 

As for what LEDS I am using, I am using RGB LEDS from amazon this is the product title, EDGELEC 100pcs 5mm RGB Tri-Color (Red Green Blue Multicolor) 4Pin LED Diodes Common Cathode 
Diffused Round Lens 29mm Long Lead +300pcs Resistors (for DC 6-12V) Included,Light Emitting Diodes.

From the Mood Lights file, you can set the pin numbers for each red green and blue. I do haave plans to just have linked shift registars to control more than 4 LEDS (12 pins), 
But that is for another time. At the moment I only have two LEDs in the file.
